We are a large-scale Chinese manufacturer that specializes in the niche market for mid to high-end hotel and restaurant furniture. Our most popular products include the sofa suite, dining chair, dining table, chaise sofa, wooden door, console cabinet, and the hotel bedroom furniture set.

<p>GELAIMEI was incorporated in 2002. Our modern workshops are equipped with imported equipment such as the high-precision sander, hi-tech wood drying device, and the high-speed automatic bench saw.

Complete sets of central dust removal and anti-pollutant instruments have been installed in our production workshops. This setup exhibits the perfect integration between modern machinery and traditional workmanship. </p>
